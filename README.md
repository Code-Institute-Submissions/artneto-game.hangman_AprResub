# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to defeat the computer by identifying all of the letters in a word or predicting the word that the computer chooses at random.
Users have just six attempts before getting "hanged" and losing all of their progress.

# How to play
Users can try to defeat the computer by identifying all of the letters in a word or predicting the word that the computer chooses at random.
Users have six attempts before getting "hanged" and losing all of their progress.
If the user correctly guesses a letter in the word, it  will be displayed on the terminal on the line in the right word position.
In case the user loses and he cannot guess the word before finishing the six rounds a game over message will appear. 


# Features

* After user input his name, he will be presented to the rules. 
* Random secret words will be masked by the signal "_". 
* The player can only guess 1 letter at the time.

* The secret word will only be revealed at the end of the game.

## Future features
  * Different levels.
  * Option to add multiplayers.


# Testing

* I manually evaluated this project by: * Running the code through a PEP8 linter and verifying there were no     errors.

* GivenÂ Invalid inputs including strings where numbers are allowed, out of bounds inputs, and the same input again.

* Tested on my own terminal as well as the Heroku terminal at the Code Institute.

# Bugs

* At first I added the list of words in the run.py but to make the code more organised I created newords.txt file. 

*  The game was only with one end-game message with no secret word revealed. I have added the option for the user see what is the secret word and also added one more funtion for game over message in order to be more clear about the result.

* I also had some Misuse Expressions issues. which causes errors and did not allow it to execute the code correctly.

# Updated 12/04/2022

* I have added  validate_letter_input to ensure the input only contains characters AZ and regex to only accept alphabetical characters.

* Another function I have added to my code is the re.fullmatch in order to return a match object if and only if the entire string matches the pattern.

## Technologies

The Python language has been used in the project. The list consists of the technologies and tools that were deployed.

* Python - choose Python Random choice() Method to random get words from my list_of_words and return the word in the game.

* HTML5

* CSS

* JavaScript

* Heroku - It was used to deploy and host the project live in the cloud.

* PEP8 Validator - to validate and check any error present on the code. 

* CSS jigsaw validator - to validate and check any error present on the css code. 


## No bugs remaining.

# Validator testing
  * PEP8 
    * No errors were returned from [PEP8online](http://pep8online.com/)
